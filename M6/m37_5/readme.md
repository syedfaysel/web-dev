# API & JS concept recap
**Module 37.5**

API:  
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API.

We can use API through JavaScript in the following way:

```js
    fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
```

Here, data is the json file that we will recieve through the api call.
